/***********************************************************
Rationale

In Hello Elementor Theme, this applies to .site-header, and
also to .site-main, which is a class of the <main> element,
at the condition that the page is not built with Elementor:
        body:not([class*="elementor-page-"])
Therefore, in pages built with Elementor, proper layout is
applied only to features managed by Elementor, not others.

Footnotes reference containers are near the bottom of main.
This style sheet lets Footnotes’ reference containers come
into the benefit of the basic responsive layout style rules
that would apply if the page were not built with Elementor.

This is mainly useful with Hello Elementor, but it may help
fix also other themes like Twenty Twenty-One for display in
older browsers not yet supporting CSS variables.
