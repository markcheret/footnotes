== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is your Plugin a fork of another Plugin? =

No, this Plugin has been written from scratch. Of course some inspirations on how to do or how to not do things were taken from other plugins.

= Your Plugin is awesome! How do I convert my footnotes if I used one of the other footnotes plugins out there? =

* For anyone interested in converting from [FD Footnotes Plugin][fd-footnotes], see [this write-up][fd-writeup] from **footnotes** user @southwest
* From what we've researched, all other footnotes Plugins use open and close shortcodes, which can be left as-is. In the **footnotes** settings menu, you can setup **footnotes** to use the existing (i.e., previously-used) shortcodes. Too easy? Yippy Ki-Yey!
