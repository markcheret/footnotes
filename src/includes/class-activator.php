 * admin-specific functionality and {@see General} for public-facing
 * functionality.

 * It also includes various utility classes:
 *
 * - {@see Activator}: defines plugin activation behaviour, called in
 *   {@see activate_footnotes()};
 * - {@see Deactivator}: defines plugin deactivation behaviour, called in
 *   {@see deactivate_footnotes()};
 * - {@see Config}: defines plugin constants;
 * - {@see Convert}: provides data conversion methods;
 * - {@see Settings}: defines configurable plugin settings; and
 * - {@see Template}: handles template rendering.
